A loop is defined as {\bf correct with respect to its pre- and post-conditions} if, and only if, whenever the algorithm variables satisfy the pre-condition for the loop and the loop termintes after a finite number of steps, the algorithm variables satisfy the pre-condition for the loop and the loop terminates after a finite number of steps, the algorithm variables satisfy the post-condition for the loop.
